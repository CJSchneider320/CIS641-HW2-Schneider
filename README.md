* I enjoy building things, and am trying to strengthen my skills as a full-stack developer and an engineer to hopefully start my own company.
* I am a big baseball and hockey fan, and do enjoy football when it comes around (not basketball though). I love watching Detroit sports teams miss the playoffs by a hair as well.
* I play video games, and enjoy live service games and roguelikes. One of my favorite things to do is to download crappy, free games off of Steam and try them. Sometimes they are not too crappy, that can be fun.

## Technical Background

* Front-end developer, specilizing in JavaScript Vue, React, and React Native. I would like to extend my mobile application knowledge into native languages (Kotlin/Swift) and Flutter
* Aspiring Back-end developer. Have worked with Java, MongoDB, AWS, and JUnit Testing. Not very confident in a lot of it, but learning nonetheless.
* 1 year of experience in start-ups, including a CRM for freelancers called Moxie and an assistant for call centers called PureCallerID (cleaning numbers, vetting outgoing calls, etc.). A part-time intern for now, but full time employment has been accepted.
* Just purchased a Mac about a month ago. Windowss user for over a decade, and am still learning to walk on the Mac. Love it so far though.

Around the Horn is a rogue-like baseball themed management game. Take a team of 9 players from the beginning of their career, and create the perfect World Series winning team!

Players will have stats that can be modified by random items and trinkets, and teams can be defined with whole-team items called "mementos". These stats, items, and mementos determine the type of hitter a player is, increasing your chances to score some runs. Adjusting your team's stats and equipping the correct items is the key to success.

The game is web-based and a demo for now, but there are plans to bring the game to a proper game engine (post-class).
